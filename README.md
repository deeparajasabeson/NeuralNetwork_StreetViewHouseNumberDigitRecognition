# NeuralNetwork_StreetViewHouseNumberDigitRecognition
As a part of AI ML course in UT Austin, completed this project making a Neural Network to identify the digits from a dataset created by Google to read house numbers and match them to their geolocations

	
	_**Problem Statement**_
	
	**Context**
	The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful as demonstrated in various applications. The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is one of the most popular ones. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to read house numbers and match them to their geolocations.
	
	**Objective**
	To build a model that can identify house numbers in an image.

		• Number of classes: 10
		• Training data: 42000 images
	    • Testing data: 18000 images
